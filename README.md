# Music-player
A menu driven Doubly Linked List data structured Playlist using the concept of doubly linked lists which is suitable in displaying the song lists, allowing the users to add a song, delete a song and display the list of songs in the playlist.With the use of file handlinh in python, we save the updation in a .txt file and hence we ensure there is no data loss after reopening the application.

Future Updation:
 We provide inbuilt python packages to play the selewcted song in Youtube.
